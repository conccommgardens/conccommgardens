    <h1>A new look a The Three Sisters</h1>

    <p>Experienced gardeners will no doubt have heard of The Three Sisters. The idea is that corn, beans, and squash grow well together given the strengths and weaknesses of each crop. 
        Last year, I tried a different variation of the method that worked well.  Instead of using corn as a tall trellis for the beans and squash to climb I used sunflowers! 
        Wild annual sunflowers, I found, make a much better support system for beans because of their branching structure and many flower heads. Another important property of sunflowers
        is below ground: a deep anchoring taproot. Corn on the other hand is technically a grass with shallow roots and no branches.</p> 

    <p>The last reason I propose for using sunflowers is speculative but backed by real ecological science. Wild sunflowers are a keystone native species that provide pollen for 
        specialist insects as well as food for insect herbivores. The insects that feed on corn are less diverse and more likely to be abundant in large numbers.</p>
